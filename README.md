- A **Contact Us** page with restaurant details.  

### **Technologies Used**

- CSS  
- JavaScript (modular approach)  
- Webpack  

### **How to Run the Project**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedMand0ur/restaurant-page.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```sh
   cd restaurant-page
   ```  
3. Install dependencies (if using Webpack):

   ```  

### **Learning Goals**
